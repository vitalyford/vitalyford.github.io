I am an Associate Professor at Arcadia University, Computer Science and Mathematics Department (<a href="https://www.arcadia.edu/profile/vitaly-ford" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">profile link</a>). I teach Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Network Security, Introduction to Practical Security Assessment (aka pentesting), and Capstone courses.</p>
<p>Also, I am serving as the Director of Cybersecurity Research and Development at the <a href="https://cyberstudents.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">National Cybersecurity Student Association</a> and the Student Chapter Coordinator for the <a href="https://www.wicys.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Women in Cybersecurity organization</a>.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2023, I co-founded Citodex, Inc., as its CTO. We are developing a SaaS product for the specialty insurance sector to automate the processing and management of documents (policies, questionnaires, etc.) using a large language model.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing table tennis and chess as well as participating in Capture the Flag competitions and coaching student cybersecurity and programming teams.</p>

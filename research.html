    <p><a href="https://github.com/vitalyford/gencybercoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">GenCyberCoin</a> project has been sponsored by the NSA/NSF GenCyber program. GenCyberCoin is an incentive to encourage GenCyber camp studentsâ€™ participation in camp activities. It teaches about:
    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
        <li>Cryptocurrency concepts and digital currency trading markets</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity principles</li>
        <li>Bug bounty program and software bugs</li>
        <li>Password management</li>
        <li>Social and ethical norms and values</li>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Inspired by the Computer Science Unplugged project, I recently developed a Capture the Flag (CTF) Unplugged that is an offline cybersecurity competition for K-8 and K-12 schools. <a href="/ctf-unplugged/CTF_Unplugged_May_2019.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">CTF Unplugged</a> introduces participants to cybersecurity competitions, shows different cybersecurity careers that they can pursue, and engages into a fun team-based competition without a need for technical preparation. For those who are interested in the project or would like to receive the answers to the CTF Unplugged, please contact me.</p>

    <p>Another recent project I have worked on is about developing cybersecurity modules and curriculum for the <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/outreach/gen-cyber.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">GenCyber Camp at Tennessee Tech</a>. I led a group at the <a href="https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Cybersecurity Education Research and Outreach Center</a> that designed a month-long cybersecurity summer camp for the K-12 students in June 2016, and a week-long GenCyber camp in June 2017.</p>

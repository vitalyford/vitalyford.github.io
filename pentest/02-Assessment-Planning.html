    <li>Managed system configuration hardening policies</li>
    <li>Multi-layered DMZs</li>
    <li>Centralized security log management</li>
    <li>Host-based security controls</li>

<h2 id="define-the-scope">Define the Scope</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Trust but verify: are you sure the clients provide IP addresses of the network they own?</li>
    <li>Discovered something out of scope? Ask the client!</li>
    <li>Rules of engagement</li>
    <li>Determine your deliverables</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="good-questions-to-ask">Good Questions to Ask</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Who has the authority to authorize testing?</li>
    <li>What is the purpose of the test?</li>
    <li>What is the proposed timeframe for the testing? Are there any restrictions as to when the testing
        can be performed?</li>
    <li>Does your customer understand the difference between a vulnerability assessment and a penetration
        test?</li>
    <li>Will you be conducting this test with, or without the cooperation of the IT security operations
        team? Are you testing their effectiveness?</li>
    <li>Is social engineering permitted? How about denial-of-service attacks?</li>
    <li>Are you able to test physical security measures used to secure servers, critical data storage, or
        anything else that requires physical access? For example, lock picking, impersonating an employee
        to gain entry into a building, or just generally walking into the areas that the average
        unaffiliated person should not have access to.</li>
    <li>Are you allowed to see the network documentation or be informed of the network architecture prior
        to testing to speed things along? (Not necessarily recommended, as this may instill doubt about the
        value of your findings. Most businesses do not expect this to be an easy information to determine
        on your own.)</li>
    <li>What are the IP ranges that you are allowed to test against? There are laws against scanning and
        testing systems without proper permissions. Be extremely diligent when ensuring that these devices
        and ranges actually belong to your client, or you may be in danger of facing legal ramifications.</li>
    <li>What are the physical locations of the company? This is more valuable to you as a tester if social
        engineering is permitted because it ensures that you are at the sanctioned buildings when testing.
        If time permits, you should let your clients know if you were able to access any of this
        information publicly in case they were under the impression that their locations were secret or
        difficult to find.</li>
    <li>What to do if there is a problem or if the initial goal of the test has been reached? Will you
        continue to test to find more entries, or is the testing over? This part is critical and ties into
        the question of why the customer wants a penetration test in the first place.</li>
    <li>Are there legal implications that you need to be aware of, such as systems that are in different
        countries and so on? Not all countries have the same laws when it comes to penetration testing.</li>
    <li>Will additional permission be required once a vulnerability has been exploited? This is important
        when performing tests on segmented networks. The client may not be aware that you can use internal
        systems as pivot points to delve deeper within their network.</li>
    <li>How are databases to be handled? Are you allowed to add records, users, and so on?</li>
